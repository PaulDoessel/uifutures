- uifutures.worker.did_user_cancel()

- uifutures.Executor(title='Job Queue', app_key='default')
    - eventually reconnect to /tmp/uifutures.{app_key}.sock
        - this will require a host to have multiple executor connections, and
          for workers to know which one they came from
    - set app name
    - set app icon

- auto dependency tracking by looking in args/kwargs for Futures
- make Future pickleable and able to reconnect to executor from a worker
    - if you pass a future then a parent failing doesn't nessesarily mean
      that a child will fail, as it may be able to catch the exception

- subjobs
    - they appear as additional progress bars and status lines under the main
      one
