- seperate process per executor
- send it pickles via a socket
- get results back via a socket
- growl (or QtApplication.notify) when done

- bgfutures.job.set_progress(type_, value, text=None, total=None)
    - several different types track their totals indepedantly

- uifutures.Executor()
    - eventually reconnect to existing one, but don't bother for now
    - set app name
    - set app icon

- dependencies

- spawn an independant process for each actual job, just like I did for qbfutures, so that we don't have to worry about code reloading, threading, etc.
